<h1 class="puzTitle">Sam Loyd&#039;s Boxer&#039;s Puzzle - Solution</h1>
<div class="puzPuzzle"><h2>The Puzzle:</h2>
<div class="puzText">

Here is an odd little puzzle-game from the East:<br />
<br />
One of the Chinese girls writes sixteen letters on a slate in four rows, as shown, and after marking a straight dash, which connects  A to B,  passes the slate to her opponent, who connects E with A. <br />
<br />
<i>(Note: they are playing the <a href="../games/dots-and-boxes.html">Dots and Boxes Game</a>, RP)</i><br />
<br />
If the first player should now connect E with F the other player would connect B with F and score &quot;one box&quot;, and have the right to play again. <br />
<br />
But they have played so well that neither one has yet scored a box, although each has played six times, but the game is reaching a critical point where one of them must win, for there are no draws (for there are nine boxes altogether in this play) as in other games. <br />
<br />
The little maiden sitting down has to play now, and if she connects M and N her opponent would score four boxes in one run, and then having the right to one more play would connect H and L, which would win all the rest. <br />
<br />
What play would you now advise, and how many boxes will it win against the best possible play of the second player?</div>
</div>
<div class="puzSep"></div>
<div class="puzSoln"><h2>Our Solution:</h3>
<div class="puzSolnText">There are many possible best moves. <br />
<br />
One of the best moves is as follows: the first player would score seven boxes by beginning with a line from G to H. If the second player then marks from J to K, the first will score two boxes by marking from K to O and P to L, and will then play the waiting move, L to H, instead of scoring two more boxes. <br />
<br />
The other player now scores the two boxes by G and K, and is then compelled to make a play which gives the first player five others. If, when the first player marks from G to H, the second player marks C-G, B-F, E-F, and then makes the waiting play of M-N, which scores four more boxes. <br />
<br />
It is this sharp play of giving your opponent two boxes so as to then get four which constitutes the pretty points of the game.</div></div>
