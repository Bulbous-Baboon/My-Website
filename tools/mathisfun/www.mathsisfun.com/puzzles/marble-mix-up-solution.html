<h1 class="puzTitle">Marble Mix Up Puzzle - Solution</h1>
<div class="puzPuzzle"><h2>The Puzzle:</h2>
<div class="puzText">
<div class="puzThumb"><img src="images/marbles-blue-yellow.svg" alt="Marble Mix Up" style="border-style: none" /></div>
Years ago, to puzzle his friends, a scientist gave one of four containers containing blue and/or yellow marbles to each of the friends; Tom, Dick, Harry, and Sally. <br />
<br />
There were 3 marbles in each container, and the number of blue marbles was different in each one. There was a piece of paper in each container telling which color marbles were in that container, but the papers had been mixed up and were ALL in the wrong containers. <br />
<br />
He then told all of his friends to take 2 marbles out of their container, read the label, and then tell him the color of the third marble.<br />
<br />
So Tom took two blue marbles out of his container and looked at the label. He was able to tell the color of the third marble immediately. <br />
<br />
Dick took 1 blue marble and 1 yellow marble from his container. After looking at his label he was able to tell the color of his remaining marble. <br />
<br />
Harry took 2 yellow marbles from his container. He looked at the label in his container, but could not tell what color the remaining marble was. <br />
<br />
Sally, without even looking at her marbles or her label, was able to tell the scientist what color her marbles were. <br />
<br />
Can you tell what color marbles Sally had? <br />
Can you also tell what color marbles the others had, and what label was in each of their containers?</div>
</div>
<div class="puzSep"></div>
<div class="puzSoln"><h2>Our Solution:</h3>
<div class="puzSolnText">Tom took two blue marbles; his label said, &quot;two blue one yellow&quot;, and this means he had to have three blue marbles because all of the labels were wrong. <br />
<br />
Dick took one blue marble and one yellow marble; his label said, &quot;one blue and two yellows&quot;, so he had to have two blues and one yellow. <br />
<br />
Harry did not know what he had because he saw two yellow marbles and the label said, &quot;three blue&quot;. <br />
<br />
Sally knew what she had because she knew what was left, two yellow marbles and one blue marble.</div></div>
