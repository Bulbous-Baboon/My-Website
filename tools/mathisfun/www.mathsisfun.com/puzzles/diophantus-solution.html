<h1 class="puzTitle">Diophantus Puzzle - Solution</h1><div class="puzPuzzle"><h2>The Puzzle:</h2><div class="puzText"><div class="puzThumb"><a href="measuring-puzzles-index.html"><img src="images/hourglass.gif" width="93" height="93" alt="Diophantus" style="border-style: none" /></a></div>We know very little about the life of the mathematician Diophantus (often known as the &#039;father of algebra&#039;) except that he came from Alexandria and he lived around the year 250 AD. <br />
<br />
However, there remains a riddle that describes the spans of Diophantus&#039;s life:<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;This tomb holds Diophantus. Ah, what a marvel! And the tomb tells scientifically the measure of his life. God vouchsafed that he should be a boy for the sixth part of his life; when a twelfth was added, his cheeks acquired a beard; He kindled for him the light of marriage after a seventh, and in the fifth year after his marriage He granted him a son. Alas! late-begotten and miserable child, when he had reached the measure of half his father&#039;s life, the chill grave took him. After consoling his grief by this science of numbers for four years, he reached the end of his life.&quot;</i><br />
<br />
In simpler English it says: Diophantus&#039;s youth lasted 1/6 of his life. He had the first beard in the next 1/12 of his life. At the end of the following 1/7 of his life Diophantus got married. Five years from then his son was born. His son lived exactly 1/2 of Diophantus&#039;s life. Diophantus died 4 years after the death of his son.<br />
<br />
How long did Diophantus live?</div></div><div class="puzSep"></div><div class="puzSoln"><h2>Our Solution:</h3><div class="puzSolnText">Here is an equation to reflect the several ages of Diophantus:<br />
<br />
(1/6)x + (1/12)x + (1/7)x + 5 + (1/2)x + 4 = x<br />
<br />
Solve that equation and the solution is x = 84 years.</div></div><div class="puzSolnFtr">See this puzzle <a href="diophantus.html">without solution</a><br />Discuss this puzzle at the <a href="http://www.mathisfunforum.com/index.php">Math is Fun Forum</a></div><div class="related"><a href="measuring-puzzles-index.html">Measuring Puzzles</a><a href="index.html">Puzzles Index</a></div><!-- #EndEditable --></div>
