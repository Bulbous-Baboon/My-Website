<h1 class="puzTitle">Lying about their age Puzzle - Solution</h1><div class="puzPuzzle"><h2>The Puzzle:</h2><div class="puzText"><div class="puzThumb"><a href="logic-puzzles-index.html"><img src="images/candle.svg" alt="Lying about their age" style="border-style: none" /></a></div>Alex, Brook, Cody, Dusty, and Erin recently found out that all of their birthdays were on the same day, though they are different ages. <br />
<br />
On their mutual birthday, they were jabbering away, flapping their gums about their recent discovery. And, lucky me, I was there. Some of the things that I overheard were...<br />
<br />
&bull; Dusty said to Brook: &quot;I&#039;m nine years older than Erin.&quot;<br />
&bull; Erin said to Brook: &quot;I&#039;m seven years older than Alex.&quot;<br />
&bull; Alex said to Brook: &quot;Your age is exactly 70% greater than mine.&quot;<br />
&bull; Brook said to Cody: &quot;Erin is younger than you.&quot;<br />
&bull; Cody said to Dusty: &quot;The difference between our ages is six years.&quot;<br />
&bull; Cody said to Alex: &quot;I&#039;m ten years older than you.&quot;<br />
&bull; Cody said to Alex: &quot;Brook is younger than Dusty.&quot;<br />
&bull; Brook said to Cody: &quot;The difference between your age and Dusty&#039;s is the same as the difference between Dusty&#039;s and Erin&#039;s.&quot;<br />
<br />
Since I knew these people -- and how old they were, I knew that they were not telling the whole truth. <br />
<br />
After thinking about it, I realized that when one of them spoke to someone older, everything they said was true, but when speaking to someone younger, everything they said was false.<br />
<br />
How old is each person?</div></div><div class="puzSep"></div><div class="puzSoln"><h2>Our Solution:</h3><div class="puzSolnText">Alex is 30<br />
Brook is 51<br />
Cody is 55<br />
Dusty is 46<br />
Erin is 37<br />
<br />
REASONING<br />
<br />
Let the ages and names of Alex, Brook, Cody, Dusty and Erin be A, B, C, D and E.<br />
<br />
C says to A, that C = A + 10. If C were younger than A, that would be lying, so C must be older than A. (But still lying.)<br />
<br />
We have A &lt; C.<br />
<br />
C says to A, that B &lt; D. As C &gt; A, C is lying, so B &gt; D.<br />
<br />
We have A &lt; C, D &lt; B.<br />
<br />
D says to B, that D = E + 9. As D &lt; B, D is telling the truth, so D &gt; E.<br />
<br />
We have A &lt; C, E &lt; D &lt; B, D = E + 9.<br />
<br />
E says to B, that E = A + 7. As E &lt; B, E is telling the truth, so E &gt; A.<br />
<br />
We have A &lt; C, A &lt; E &lt; D &lt; B, D = E + 9, E = A + 7.<br />
<br />
Since D = E + 9 and E = A + 7, D = A + 7 + 9 = A + 16.<br />
<br />
We have A &lt; C, A &lt; E &lt; D &lt; B, D = E + 9 = A + 16, E = A + 7.<br />
<br />
B says to C, that E &lt; C. If B &gt; C then B would be lying, so then E &gt; C, and then A &lt; C &lt; E &lt; D &lt; B. However, C says to D, that C = D &plusmn; 6; since C &lt; D, this gives C = D - 6. However, we have E = D - 9, which would make E &lt; C, giving a contradiction. The assumption that B &gt; C is therefore false, so B &lt; C.<br />
<br />
We have A &lt; E &lt; D &lt; B &lt; C, D = E + 9 = A + 16, E = A + 7.<br />
<br />
A says to B, that B = (17/10)A. As A &lt; B, A is telling the truth.<br />
<br />
We have A &lt; E &lt; D &lt; B &lt; C, B = (17/10)A, D = E + 9 = A + 16, E = A + 7.<br />
<br />
B says to C, that |C - D| = |D - E| ? |C - D| = 9. As B &lt; C, B is telling the truth, so C = D + 9. As D = A + 16, C = A + 16 + 9 ? C = A + 25.<br />
<br />
We have A &lt; E &lt; D &lt; B &lt; C, B = (17/10)A, C = A + 25, D = A + 16, E = A + 7.<br />
<br />
Using D &lt; B &lt; C, we have A + 16 &lt; (17/10)A &lt; A + 25 ? 16 &lt; (7/10)A &lt; 25 ? 160/7 &lt; A &lt; 250/7 ? 22 + 6/7 &lt; A &lt; 35 + 5/7. Since B and A must both be whole numbers, and B = (17/10)A ? B - A = (7/10)A, (7/10)A must be a whole number. Hence A must be divisible by 10. The only whole number fitting 22 + 6/7 &lt; A &lt; 35 + 5/7 is A = 30.<br />
<br />
We have A = 30, B = (17/10)A, C = A + 25, D = A + 16, E = A + 7.<br />
<br />
Hence A = 30, B = 51, C = 55, D = 46, E = 37.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
A VERBAL DESCRIPTION OF THE REASONING<br />
<br />
Cody tells Alex she&#039;s older than her by 10 years. If Cody is younger, she&#039;s lying, and that&#039;s impossible, so Cody must be older than Alex, just not by 10 years.<br />
<br />
FACT: Cody is older than Alex (but not by 10 years).<br />
<br />
Cody also lies to (younger) Alex that Brook is younger than Dusty.<br />
<br />
FACT: Dusty is older than Brook.<br />
<br />
Dusty tells the truth to (older) Brook that she&#039;s 9 years older than Erin.<br />
<br />
FACT: Dusty is 9 years older than Erin.<br />
<br />
Erin tells the truth to (older) Brook that she&#039;s 7 years older than Alex.<br />
<br />
FACT: Erin is 7 years older than Alex.<br />
<br />
Alex tells the truth to (older) Brook that Brook&#039;s age is 70% greater than her own. For Brook&#039;s age to be a whole number, Alex&#039;s age must be a multiple of 10. Since Brook is older than Dusty, and Dusty is 7 + 9 = 16 years older than Alex, that means Brook has to be more than 16 years older than Alex. The lowest multiple of 7 greater than 16 is 21.<br />
<br />
FACT: Alex is at least 30 years old (and definitely a multiple of 10).<br />
<br />
At this point, Brook appears to be the oldest, lying lady. Let&#039;s assume that, and see if it works.<br />
<br />
In that case, Cody is lying to Dusty that the difference in their ages is 6 years, but Brook tells the truth to (older) Cody that the difference between Cody&#039;s age and Dusty&#039;s is the same as the difference between Dusty&#039;s and Erin&#039;s, namely, 9 years. Let&#039;s test this scenario, assuming Alex&#039;s age is 30. Then we get, from youngest to oldest:<br />
<br />
TESTING: Alex = 30, Erin = 37, Dusty = 46, Brook = 51, Cody = 55<br />
<br />
Checking all statements and the age relations shows that this is an answer. Is this the only answer?<br />
<br />
If Alex&#039;s age was 40, then Brook&#039;s age would be 68, and Cody&#039;s age would be 65, so Cody would not be the oldest, and that would be a fatal flaw. If Alex is older than 30, Brook is older than Cody, and Cody is not the oldest. Hence, it must have been the only answer.</div></div><div class="puzSolnFtr">See this puzzle <a href="lying-about-their-age.html">without solution</a><br />Discuss this puzzle at the <a href="http://www.mathisfunforum.com/index.php">Math is Fun Forum</a></div><div class="related"><a href="logic-puzzles-index.html">Logic Puzzles</a><a href="index.html">Puzzles Index</a></div><!-- #EndEditable --></div>
