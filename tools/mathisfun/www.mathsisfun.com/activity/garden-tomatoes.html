			<h1 class="center">Activity: Tomatoes for the Garden</h1>
			<p><span class="larger">How many tomato plants can fit into your garden?</span><br></p>
			<p>And, if all the conditions for growth are right, what is your expected yield?</p>
			
			<div class="center80">
			<p><strong>This  depends on:</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>The size of your garden</li>
				<li>How close together you plant the tomato plants</li>
			</ul>
			</div>
			
			<p>Plant them too close and they won't grow well, so you will need to spread them out.</p>
			<p>You could find 
				out the best distance between  plants from a gardening book, or the internet.</p>
			<p><i>And it  may  depend on the variety of tomato, so make sure you do your research first.</i></p>
			
			<h2>Your first step is to find the shape of your garden and plot it on a sheet of paper.</h2>
			<p>You can do the <a href="garden-area.html">Garden Area</a> activity first if you want</p>
			
			
			<div class="example">
				<p>As an example, suppose they must be planted 50cm  apart,</p>
				<p>How could they best 
					 fit into the example garden below?</p>
			</div>
<p class="center"><img src="images/garden-tomato-1.gif" width="223" height="190"  alt="garden tomato 1" /></p>
			
			<h3>If you plant one tomato plant at random in the garden, say at point X, then where do you plant the next one?</h3>
			<p>It has to be at least 50cm away, so it could be anywhere on the <b>circumference 
			of the circle</b> of radius 5ocm, like this:</p>
			<p class="center"><img src="images/garden-tomato-2.gif" width="266" height="175"  alt="garden tomato 50cm" /></p>
			
			<h3>Choose any spot on the circle, then draw another circle ...	like	this:</h3>
			<p class="center"><img src="images/garden-tomato-3.gif" width="224" height="188"  alt="garden tomato 2" /></p>
			
			<p>Continue on like that ...</p>
			<p class="center"><img src="images/garden-tomato-4.gif" width="222" height="188"  alt="garden tomato 2 rows" /></p>
			<p>Just make sure each plant is no closer than 50cm to any other one.</p>
			<p><b>That was just one way</b> ... not even a  good one, as  there is wasted space along the edge of the garden.</p>
			<p>So hopefully you can do better.<br></p>
<h2>Here are some ideas:<strong></strong></h2>
<ul>
				<li>Pick a good starting position (in other words, where do you place point X?)</li>
				<li>Is it  better to start measuring from one edge of the garden? But then, not all edges are straight, so which edge should I choose?</li>
				<li>Maybe a grid will help, like this one:</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p class="center"><img src="images/garden-tomato-5.gif" width="229" height="185"  alt="garden on grid" /></p>
			
			<p>Keep each of your attempts, it is interesting to see how you can improve on your plan.</p>
<p>Good Luck!</p>
			
			<h2>What is your expected yield?</h2>
			<p>Once you've decided on how many plants you can fit into your garden, 
			then you can work out the expected yield of tomatoes from your garden. 
			That's a simple multiplication.</p>
			
			<div class="example">
			<p>For example, I estimate that I can plant 200 tomato plants in my garden and the expected yield per plant is 5 kg.</p>
			<p>So I  expect the total yield to be about 
				<strong>200 &times; 5kg = 1,000kg</strong> or <strong>1 tonne</strong>!</p>
			</div>
			
			<p>And, if I sell my tomatoes for $2 a kilogram, then I'm on to a winner.
			Perhaps this is a better choice than having a lawn in my back garden!</p>
			
			<h2>But what about the cost of fertiliser and insecticides and all the time 
			it takes to nurture those tomatoes?</h2>
			<p>Well, that's another story ... you  can work all that out!</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			
			<h2>Follow Up</h2>
			
			<p>Instead of planting tomatoes, what about having a 
			barbecue party for your friends?</p>
			<p>But how many friends could you invite 
				to your party without the garden being overcrowded?</p>
			<p><b>Just use the same method!</b></p>
			<p>Except the plants are replaced by people, and maybe they should be 
				two meters apart instead of 50 centimeters. But the idea is the 
			same.</p>
