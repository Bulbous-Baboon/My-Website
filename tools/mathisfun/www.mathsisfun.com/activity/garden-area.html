			<p style="float:left; margin: 0 10px 5px 0;"><img src="images/garden.jpg" width="220" height="133"  alt="garden" /></p>
			<p class="center larger"><i>Have you ever wondered what the area of your garden is?</i></p>
			<p class="center larger">Let us try and find out!</p>
			<div style="clear:both"></div>
			<div class="center80">
				<p class="center larger">You will need a garden, a tape measure, pen and paper ... and your brains.</p>
			</div>
			<h2>I don't have a garden, so what can I do?</h2>
			<p>If you don't have a garden, maybe a friend has one, or your relatives have one, so use theirs.</p>
			<p style="float:left; margin: 0 10px 5px 0;"><img src="../measure/images/tape-measure.jpg" width="95" height="133"  alt="tape measure" /></p>
			<h2>How accurate should my measurements be?</h2>
			<p>Try to measure to the nearest centimeter (or half-inch), so the error will be as small as possible.</p>
			<p>You should get a good estimate, as long as you are careful with your measuring.</p>
			
			<h2>Is there a simple way to find the area of my garden?</h2>
			<p>If your garden is a rectangle, then you have a simple calculation. You just have to measure its width and length and multiply them together:</p>
			<table border="0" align="center">
				<tr>
					<td><img src="images/area-rectangle.gif" width="101" height="68"  alt="area rectangle" /></td>
					<td>&nbsp;</td>
					<td><p class="larger">Rectangle: 
							Area = W &times; L</p>
						<ul>
							<li>W = width</li>
							<li>L = length</li>
						</ul></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p class="center"><b>But that makes this activity just too easy ... <br>
			... so go find another garden with a more interesting shape!</b></p>
			<h2>My garden is a difficult shape, so how can I find its area?</h2>
			<p>Good! This activity just got <i><b>interesting</b></i> ...</p>
			<p>It may be one of the  shapes on the page <a href="../area.html">Area of Plane Shapes</a>, then you just have to decide which shape, make the  measurements, and use the  formula.</p>
			<div class="center80">
				<p class="center">But you  could also break up your difficult shape into  <a href="../triangle.html">triangles</a>:<br>
					<img src="../geometry/images/area-3-triangles.gif" width="176" height="126"  alt="area 3 triangles" /><br>
					<br>
					Then measure the base (<b>b</b>) and height (<b>h</b>) of each triangle: <br>
				<img src="../geometry/images/area-3-triangles-b.gif" width="306" height="148"  alt="area 3 triangles separated" /></p>
				<p class="center">Write down each measurement carefully so you know which triangle it belongs to.</p>
				<p class="center">Now go inside and calculate each area 
					(using <span class="larger">Area = &frac12;b &times; h</span>) and add  them all up.</p>
			</div>
			<h2>But my garden is different ...</h2>
			<p class="larger">... in fact it's not any shape at all ... it has some straight edges and some curved parts. What should I do?</p>
			<p>Maybe it looks something like this:</p>
			<p class="center"><img src="images/garden-area.gif" width="215" height="180"  alt="garden area" /><br></p>
			<p>You could try covering your garden with a grid of squares â€“ these could be 1 meter squares or 1 foot squares, something like this:</p>
			<p class="center"><img src="images/garden-area-grid.gif" width="350" height="207"  alt="garden area grid" /><br></p>
			<h3>How do I make a grid?</h3>
			<p>Try using pegs in the ground and join them up with string. Make sure they are the right distance apart and all angles are right angles.</p>
			<h3>How does this help? The grid and the outline of the garden don't match. There are lots of corners and curved parts.</h3>
			<p>Count the squares!</p>
			<p>There are special methods talked about on the <a href="../geometry/area.html">Area</a> page. The simplest method is:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>more than half a square counts as 1</li>
				<li>less than half a square counts as 0</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="center"><br>
				<img src="images/garden-area-grid-count.gif" width="358" height="206"  alt="garden area grid count" /><br>
				An estimate for this area is <b>41 m<sup>2</sup></b>. <br>
				(This is just an example. 
				Your garden is different of course.)</p>
			<p>If your grid is 1 foot by 1 foot, then the area will be in square feet.&nbsp;</p>
			<h2>Why should I want to know the area of my garden?</h2>
			<p>There might be lots of reasons:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>You want to re-turf the garden. How much grass should you order? How much will it cost?</li>
				<li>You want to plant the garden with tomato plants. These have to be planted a certain distance apart. How many plants could you plant? What will be your expected yield of tomatoes?</li>
				<li>You want to hold a barbeque party. How many people could comfortably fit into your garden?</li>
			</ul>
			<p align="center" class="center80">You  can now do  <a href="garden-grass.html">Activity: Grass for the Garden</a></p>
			<h2>I am finished ... what have I learned?</h2>
			<p>You have learned about measuring, recording data, drawing, and calculating area, well done!</p>
