			<h1 class="center">Activity: Estimation</h1>
			<p>This
				activity is about <a
 href="../numbers/estimation.html">estimation</a> and doing a <a href="../definitions/survey.html">survey</a>.</p>
			<h2>How
				many red marbles?</h2>
			<p style="float:left; margin: 0 10px 5px 0;"><img src="images/marbles-asstd.gif" width="99" height="114"  alt="marbles assorted" /></p>
			<p>For this experiment you will need a bag of marbles of various
				colors - red, blue, green, yellow etc. The total number of marbles is
				not really important, but you will find it easier to work with a number
				like 50. What is important is that you do not know how many of each
				color there are. So you will have to ask a friend or relative to choose
				the marbles for you.</p>
			<p>You will <a
 href="../numbers/estimation.html">estimate</a> how many red marbles there are in the bag.</p>
			<h3>So why don't you just count them?</h3>
			<p>Of course you could, but this experiment will teach you how to make an
				estimate.</p>
			<p>Scientists and statisticians use this method all the time to
				make estimates in
				real world situations where they can't just simply count.</p>
			<div class="example">
				<h3>Example: Blood Types</h3>
				<p>There are four different human blood types, called A, B, AB and O.</p>
				<p><b>To test everyone, as you can imagine, would be very hard!</b></p>
				<p>So to find out
					how many people in the world have each blood type, scientists take a
					sample of (say) 1,000 people and test their blood type.</p>
				<p>From the sample
					they can estimate how many of each type there are in the world.&nbsp;</p>
			</div>
			<h2>Now you're ready to begin the experiment. It's very simple.</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Shake
					the marbles in the bag.</li>
				<li>Take
					one marble without looking and record its color.</li>
				<li>Return
					the marble to the bag.</li>
				<li>Repeat
					this process 100 times.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Why do you return the marble to the bag?<br></h2>
			<p>So that the conditions for choosing the second
				marble are exactly the same as the conditions for choosing the first
				marble.</p>
			<p>If the first marble you choose is red and you don't replace
				it, then for your second
				choice there is one less red marble in the bag, which  makes the chance of choosing another red marble
				less.</p>
			<h2>How do you record the color?</h2>
			<p><strong>You can use a <a href="../data/tally-marks.html">tally/frequency</a> table like this:</strong></p>
			<table border="1" align="center" cellpadding="2"
 cellspacing="2">
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<td><strong>Color</strong></td>
						<td><strong>Tally</strong></td>
						<td><strong>Frequency</strong></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Red</td>
						<td></td>
						<td></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Blue</td>
						<td></td>
						<td></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Green</td>
						<td></td>
						<td></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Yellow</td>
						<td></td>
						<td></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Purple</td>
						<td></td>
						<td></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td></td>
						<td></td>
						<td>Total = 100</td>
					</tr>
				</tbody>
			</table>
			<br>
			<br>
			<div class="center80">
				<p>I have included five colors in my table, but yours could be different.</p>
				<p>Once you've completed choosing 100 times, you can work out the <a
 href="../data/relative-frequency.html">relative
					frequency</a> of red by dividing the number of red marbles by 100.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>For example, if you record
	<strong>22 red marbles</strong> in your table, then the
					relative frequency of <strong>red</strong> 
					is 
					<strong>22/100 = 0.22</strong></p>
			</div>
			<h2>How does this help you estimate the
				number of red marbles in the bag?</h2>
			<p>That's easy. If there are <strong>50</strong> marbles in the bag and <strong>red</strong> occurred <strong>22</strong> times out of <strong>100</strong>, then it should occur <strong>11</strong> times out of <strong>50</strong>.</p>
			<p>In other words, the fractions <strong>22/100</strong> and <strong>11/50</strong> are <a
 href="../equivalent_fractions.html">equivalent
				fractions</a>.<br>
				An easier way is just to multiply <strong>0.22 by 50</strong>: <strong>0.22 &times; 50 = 11</strong></p>
			<p>When you've finished the calculations, you can check how many red
				marbles there really are in the bag.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>How good was your estimate?</strong></li>
				<li><strong>How can you get a better estimate?</strong></li>
			</ul>
			<p>To get a better estimate, don't count straight away.<br>
				Instead, repeat the
				experiment several times and calculate the <a
 href="../mean.html">mean</a> number of red
				marbles.</p>
			<p>Then you can compare your mean number with the actual number in the
				bag.<br>
				You should get a much better estimate, and may even get it exactly
				right.</p>
			<div class="center80">
				<p>As a variation on this experiment, you could use Smarties or M and M's.
					 But you may be  tempted
					to eat some and ruin the results of your experiment!</p>
			</div>
			<h2>How many A's?</h2>
			<p>Another variation on
				the above experiment can be done using the letters from the game of
				Scrabble. In the game of Scrabble there are 100 tiles. 98 of the tiles
				are inscribed with letters of the alphabet, the other two are blank. Remove the blank ones, so you will have 98 tiles.</p>
			<div class="center80">
				<p>If you don't have the game of Scrabble, then you could make your own
					tiles. You<strong> will need 98 square pieces of cardboard, all the same size:
					2 cm by 2 cm will do. </strong></p>
				<p>Write letters on the tiles as follows:</p>
				<table border="0" align="center">
					<tr>
						<td width="200"><ul>
								<li>9 A's</li>
								<li>2 B's</li>
								<li>2 C's,</li>
								<li>4 D's,</li>
								<li>12
									E's,</li>
								<li>2 F's,</li>
								<li>3 G's,</li>
								<li>2 H's,</li>
								<li>9 I's,</li>
								<li>1 J,</li>
								<li>1 K,</li>
								<li>4 L's,</li>
								<li>2 M's,</li>
							</ul></td>
						<td width="200"><ul>
								<li>6 N's,</li>
								<li>8 O's,</li>
								<li>2 P's,</li>
								<li>1 Q,</li>
								<li>6 R's,</li>
								<li>4 S's,</li>
								<li>6 T's,</li>
								<li>4 U's,</li>
								<li>2 V's,</li>
								<li>2 W's,</li>
								<li>1 X,</li>
								<li>2 Y's</li>
								<li>1
									Z</li>
							</ul></td>
					</tr>
				</table>
			</div>
			<p>Pretend that you don't know
				how many A's there are.  
				Now do the experiment in the same way that you did the marbles
				experiment.</p>
			<p><br>
				<strong>Record your results in a table as before:</strong></p>
			<table border="1" align="center" cellpadding="2"
 cellspacing="2">
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<td><strong>Letter</strong></td>
						<td><strong>Tally</strong></td>
						<td><strong>Frequency</strong></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>A</td>
						<td></td>
						<td></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>B</td>
						<td></td>
						<td></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>C</td>
						<td></td>
						<td></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>D</td>
						<td></td>
						<td></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>E</td>
						<td></td>
						<td></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>etc ...</td>
						<td></td>
						<td></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td></td>
						<td></td>
						<td>Total = 100</td>
					</tr>
				</tbody>
			</table>
			<div class="center80">
				<p>The only
					difference is that you will need a much longer table going all the way
					to Z.</p>
				<p>When you've
					finished, calculate the&nbsp;<a
 href="../data/relative-frequency.html">relative
					frequency</a> of the letter <strong>A</strong> and
					estimate the number of A's in the bag by multiplying the relative
					frequency by <strong>98</strong>.</p>
				<p>Do this several times and calculate the&nbsp;<a
 href="../mean.html">mean</a>.</p>
				<br>
			</div>
			<h3>What result did you get?</h3>
			<h2>How many people have blood type O?</h2>
			<p>Now you've learned how to make an estimate from a sample,
				you are ready to do a real-life experiment.<br>
				Before you begin you should
				read the pages <a
 href="../data/survey-conducting.html">How to Do
				a Survey</a> and <a href="../data/survey-questionnaire.html">Survey
				Questions</a>.</p>
			<h2><br>
				How many people in the world have
				blood type O?</h2>
			<p>There
				are four different human blood types, called <strong>A</strong>, <strong>B</strong>, <strong>AB</strong> and <strong>O</strong>
				. It is
				obviously impractical to test everybody in the world; so, to find out
				how many people in the world have each blood type, you  get
				a
				sample of&nbsp;100 people and find out their blood type. From the
				sample you can estimate how many people in the world have
				blood type O.</p>
			<p>But this could be a difficult  experiment as many people don't even
				know their own blood type!</p>
			<p>And, since you can't test them for blood
				type, you will have to just count the ones who do know. So to get 100 who <b>do</b> know their blood type means a sample size much greater than 100.</p>
			<div class="center80">
				<p><strong>Note:</strong> Depending on where you live in the world, you could use a
					different physical characteristic such as hair color or eye color. But,
					if you live in some countries, you may not have a good variation of
					different colors. That's why I chose blood type.</p>
			</div>
			<h2>Which sample?</h2>
			<p>If you are still at school, then you could use your school population
				do do your survey. Ask permission first, then go around different
				classrooms.</p>
			<p>But you might get a better result doing your survey in a
				local shopping center or mall. When you stop people, tell them that you
				are doing a survey and politely ask them if they would mind telling you
				their blood type.</p>
			<h3>Ignore the ones who refuse to answer or who don't know.</h3>
			<p><strong>Keep going
				until you have 100 positive answers.</strong><br>
				Record your results in a table, as follows:</p>
			<table border="1" align="center" cellpadding="2"
 cellspacing="2">
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<td><strong>Blood type</strong></td>
						<td><strong>Tally</strong></td>
						<td><strong>Frequency</strong></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>A</td>
						<td></td>
						<td></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>B</td>
						<td></td>
						<td></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>AB</td>
						<td></td>
						<td></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>O</td>
						<td></td>
						<td></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td></td>
						<td></td>
						<td>Total = 100</td>
					</tr>
				</tbody>
			</table>
			<br>
			When you have
			finished, you can work out the relative frequency of blood type <strong>O</strong> from
			your sample.<br>
			Divide the number with blood type <strong>O </strong>by <strong>100</strong>.
			<p>You can expect to get a better result if you use a bigger sample,		or if
				you take several samples and calculate the mean.</p>
			<p>Now all you need to know is how many people there are in the world. A quick search on the internet should answer this for you.</p>
			<h2>Can you now estimate how many people in the world have blood type O?</h2>
