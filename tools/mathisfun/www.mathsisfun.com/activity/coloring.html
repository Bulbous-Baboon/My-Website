			<h1 class="center">Coloring (The Four Color
			Theorem)</h1>
			<p style="text-align: left;">This activity is about coloring, but don't
				think it's just kid's stuff. This investigation will lead to one of the
				most famous theorems of mathematics and some very interesting results.</p>
			<p style="text-align: left;">Have you ever colored in a pattern and
				wondered <b>how many colors</b> you need to use?</p>
			<p style="text-align: left;">There is only one rule</p>
			<div class="center80">
				<p class="center larger">Two sections that share a common edge cannot be colored the same!</p>
			</div>
			<p style="text-align: left;">Having a  common corner is OK, just not an edge.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Let's start with a simple pattern like a group
				of nine squares:</p>
<p class="center"><img src="images/coloring-1.gif" width="198" height="198"  alt="nine square grid" /><br>
			<input type="button" onClick="printImg('images/coloring-1.gif')" value="Print" /></p>
			<p style="text-align: left;">How many colors do you need to color the
				pattern of nine squares?</p>
			<p style="text-align: left;">You could use nine different colors, but
				could make do with as few as <b>two</b>:</p>
			<p class="center"><img src="images/coloring-2.gif" width="196" height="196"  alt="nine square grid colored" /></p>
			<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>
			<h2 style="text-align: left;">A Little More Complicated</h2>
			<p style="text-align: left;">How about this one?</p>
			<p class="center"><img src="images/coloring-3.gif" width="212" height="210"  alt="circle grid" />
				<br>
				<input type="button" onClick="printImg('images/coloring-3.gif')" value="Print" /></p>
			<p class="center">How many colors do you need this time?</p>
			<p class="center larger">Your turn ... try it ... then scroll down to see my answer</p>
			<p class="center">...</p>
			<p class="center">...</p>
			<p align="left">You could use four different colors, or you could make do with just
				<b>three</b>:</p>
			<p class="center"><img src="images/coloring-4.gif" width="209" height="210"  alt="circle grid colored" /></p>
			<p>But you couldn't color this pattern with just two colors. Can you see
				why?</p>
			<h2>Even More Complicated</h2>
			<p>Let's try another:</p>
			<p class="center"><img src="images/coloring-5.gif" width="240" height="239"  alt="fancy circle sections" />
				<br>
				<input type="button" onClick="printImg('images/coloring-5.gif')" value="Print" /></p>
			<p>How many colors do you need this time?</p>
			<p>Nine? Eight? Seven? Six? Five? Four?</p>
			<p class="center larger">Try it yourself before looking at my answer.</p>
			<p class="center">...</p>
			<p class="center">...</p>
			<table border="0" align="center">
				<tr>
					<td><p>I needed four colors to color this pattern.</p>
						<p>I can change the colors
						around a bit, but I  still need four.</p>
						<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"> I
					can't color this pattern with fewer than four colors</span>.</p></td>
					<td><img src="images/coloring-6.gif" width="179" height="179"  alt="fancy circle sections colored" /></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<h2>Maps</h2>
			<p>This could get a bit more interesting if we wanted to color a map.</p>
			<p><i>A map may not work when a country has two or more separate areas, such as Alaska (part of the US, but with Canada in-between) or Kaliningrad (part of Russia, but also not joined). But let's ignore that here.</i></p>
<p>Here
				is a map of part of Europe, showing nine countries and how they border
				on each other:<span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span></p>
			<p class="center"><img src="images/coloring-europe-blank.svg" alt="europe blank" />
				<br>
				<input type="button" onClick="printImg('images/coloring-europe-blank.svg')" value="Print" /></p>
			<p class="center"><span class="larger">Try coloring in the map and see what is the fewest number of colors you
				need. </span></p>
			<p>Again, don't look at my answer until you have tried it yourself!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="center">...</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center">...</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Here is how I did it. I needed to use four
			colors:</p>
			<p class="center"><img src="images/coloring-europe-color.svg" alt="europe colored" /></p>
			<h2>Four Colors</h2>
			<p>It seems that any
				pattern or map can always be colored with <b>four colors</b>.</p>
			<p>In some cases,
				like the first example, we could use fewer than four. In many cases we could
				use a lot more colors if we wanted to, but a maximum of <b>four colors is
				enough</b>!</p>
			<p>This result has become one of the most famous theorems of mathematics
				and is known as <span style="font-weight: bold;">The Four Color
				Theorem.</span></p>
			<h3>So why is it important?</h3>
			<p>It is important because it was first stated in 1852, but was not proved
				until 1976. For over one hundred and twenty years some of the best
				mathematical brains in the world were unsuccessful in proving one of
				the simplest theorems in mathematics. There were many false proofs, and
				a whole new branch of mathematics - known as <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Graph Theory</span> - was developed to try
				to solve the theorem. But nobody could prove it until in 1976 Appel and
				Haken proved the theorem with the aid of a computer.</p>
			<p>Some people think
				that, although their proof was correct, it was cheating to use a
				computer. What do you think?</p>
			<h2>A Map Can Be Changed!</h2>
			<p>Now look again at our previous two examples:</p>
			<p class="center"><img src="images/coloring-europe-reshape.svg" alt="europe colored vs circular sections" /></p>
			<p class="center large">Can you see the similarity between these two diagrams?</p>
			<p>Imagine the map of European countries was drawn on a piece of rubber
				that could be stretched. By stretching and skewing the piece of rubber
				in a certain way, you could end up with the circular diagram.</p>
			<p class="center larger">We say they are <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">homeomorphic. </span></p>
			<p>That's a big word, but  a very simple idea: <b>one can become the other</b>.</p>
			<p>It also forms part
				of  a huge branch of mathematics known as<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> Topology. </span></p>
			<h2>One More: US States</h2>
			<p>Here is one for you to try on your own ... the &quot;contiguous&quot; (meaning all touching) United States (no Alaska or Hawaii).</p>
			<p>Can you color it using only 4 colors?</p>
			<p class="center"><img src="images/coloring-10.gif" width="714" height="425"  alt="US contiguous blank" />
				<br>
				<input type="button" onClick="printImg('images/coloring-10.gif')" value="Print" /></p>
