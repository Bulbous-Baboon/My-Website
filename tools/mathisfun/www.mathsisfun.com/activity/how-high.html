			<h1 class="center">Activity: How High?</h1>
			<p>For this activity you will need:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>A piece of cardboard or thin sheet of wood, about the size
					of a sheet of paper.</li>
				<li>A piece of string about 30cm or 1 foot long:</li>
			</ul>
			<img alt="string" src="images/howhigh1.jpg">
			<ul>
				<li>A drawing pin (thumbtack) or a small nail:</li>
			</ul>
			<img alt="pin" src="images/howhigh2.jpg">
			<ul>
				<li>A small rock (one you can tie the string to):</li>
			</ul>
			<img alt="howhigh3" src="images/howhigh3.jpg">
			<ul>
				<li>A tape measure:</li>
			</ul>
			<img alt="tape measures" src="images/howhigh4.jpg">
			<ul>
				<li>scissors</li>
				<li>glue</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h2>Aim</h2>
			The aim of this activity is to measure the height of a tall building or
			tree.<br>
			I will illustrate this with a tree, but the method is just the
			same for a building.<br>
			<br>
			<p class="center"><img alt="tree" src="images/howhigh5.jpg"></p>
			<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
			<h3>Suppose you want to measure the height.</h3>
			<p><strong>Can I just measure it with
a tape measure?</strong><br>
				That won't be easy. You may have to climb the tree to do that. Dangerous!</p>
			<p>But there is another, easier, way!</p>
			<div class="center80">
				<p>Measure a length <b>along the ground</b> and measure the <b>angle&nbsp;θ</b> to the top of the tree:</p>
				<p class="center"><img alt="tree with angle" src="images/howhigh6.jpg"></p>
				<p><i>Surveyors and engineers use special equipment to measure these
					distances and angles accurately. The instrument they use to measure the
					angle is called a theodolite.
					In this activity you will make a simple theodolite. You won't get
					accurate answers, but it will help you to understand how surveyors do
					their work.</i></p>
			</div>
			<p><strong>There are three parts to this activity:</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Making a simple theodolite.</li>
				<li>Measuring the angle and the distance along the ground.</li>
				<li>Using the measurements to find the height of the tree.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Making a Simple Theodolite</h2>
			<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Print
				out this <a href="images/howhigh7.jpg">image</a> of a protractor onto A4 paper.<br>
				You will need to change the page
				orientation to landscape. </p>
			<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> You do not need to cut
				out the picture of the protractor, but you will need to cut as near as
				you can to the top edge - just leave a small space, enough for you to
				attach the drawing pin or nail.</p>
			<p><strong>Step3:</strong> Glue your picture of the
				protractor with its straight-edge lying along the<br>
				top edge of your
				cardboard or timber:</p>
			<p class="center"><img alt="protractor on wood" src="images/howhigh8.svg"></p>
			<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Tie the small rock to
				one end of the piece of string:</p>
			<p class="center"><img alt="rock on string" src="images/howhigh9.jpg"></p>
			<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Attach the other end of
				the string to the top middle point of the <br>
				protractor using the drawing
				pin or
				nail:</p>
			<p class="center"><img alt="protractor on wood with rock on string" src="images/howhigh10.jpg"></p>
			<p>When you allow the rock to pull the string downwards, gravity will make
				it hang vertically. Even if you tilt the piece of cardboard or timber
				at an angle, the string will still hang vertically:</p>
			<p class="center"><img alt="protractor string at 90" src="images/howhigh11a.svg"> &nbsp; <img alt="protractor string at 60" src="images/howhigh11b.svg"></p>
			<p><strong>Can you see how the angle of 30°
				is related to the angle shown by the string on the protractor?</strong></p>
			<h2><br>
				Measuring the Angle
				and the Distance Along the Ground</h2>
			<p>First of all, find a good place to stand&nbsp; about <strong>100 feet or 30m
				away from the tree</strong>. Make sure that you are standing on level ground and
				in a safe place. Mark the place with a stick. Now you are ready to
				measure.</p>
			<p>To measure the angle, you just point your 'theodolite'' towards the top
				of the tree. Put your eye as close as possible to one edge of the
				protractor; then, looking along the straight edge, point it directly at
				the top of the tree:</p>
			<p class="center"><img alt="howhigh12" src="images/howhigh12.jpg"></p>
			<p>Hold the string and weight in position before you lower the theodolite.
				Then read the angle from the theodolite as the angle the vertical
				weight on
				the string &nbsp;makes with the protractor. Adjust your answer to find
				the <a href="../algebra/trig-finding-angle-right-triangle.html">angle
				of elevation</a>, <strong>θ</strong>, from
				your eye to the top of the tree.</p>
			<p>To find the distance, <strong>d</strong>, use your tape measure to measure from the
				stick to the base of the tree, or more exactly to the midpoint of the
				base of the tree - <strong>can you see how to make allowance for that?</strong></p>
			<h2>Using the
				Measurements to Find the Height of the Tree</h2>
			<p>You can calculate the height of the tree using a scale diagram on a
				piece of paper,<br>
				following these steps:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Draw a horizontal line:</li>
			</ul>
			<img alt="howhigh13" src="images/howhigh13.jpg">
			<ul start="2">
				<li>At a point, <strong>C</strong>, near the right end of the line, measure an angle
					equal to the angle, <strong>θ</strong>, from your experiment:</li>
			</ul>
			<img alt="howhigh14" src="images/howhigh14.jpg">
			<ul start="3">
				<li>Choosing a suitable scale, measure the distance x equivalent to
					the distance <strong>d</strong> you measured in your experiment. Mark a point <strong>B</strong>:</li>
			</ul>
			<img alt="howhigh15" src="images/howhigh15.jpg">
			<ul start="4">
				<li>Draw the perpendicular at <strong>B</strong> to meet the sloping line at <strong>A</strong>:</li>
			</ul>
			<img alt="howhigh16" src="images/howhigh16.jpg">
			<ul start="5">
				<li>Measure the height, <strong>y</strong>, of <strong>A</strong> above <strong>B</strong>:</li>
			</ul>
			<img alt="howhigh17" src="images/howhigh17.jpg">
			<ul start="6">
				<li>Using the scale from step 3, convert <strong>y</strong> back to find the height, <strong>h</strong>, of the tree.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Wait!</h2>
			<ul class="bigul">
				<li>Did you notice anything wrong?</li>
				<li>Where was your eye when you measured the angle θ?</li>
				<li>Can you think of a way to compensate for that error?</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Another Way</h2>
			<p>There is an alternative way to calculate the height of the tree using <a href="../sine-cosine-tangent.html">trigonometry</a>.<br>
				If you know how to do this, then go ahead.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>How accurate will your answer be?</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Can you list below some things about this experiment that tell you that
				your answer is not very accurate?</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>&nbsp;</li>
				<li>&nbsp;</li>
				<li>&nbsp;</li>
				<li>&nbsp;</li>
				<li>&nbsp;</li>
			</ol>
			<h3>Any more?</h3>

			<p><strong>Try to find out how</strong><strong> a real theodolite is made and why it gives much
			more accurate measurements.</strong></p>
