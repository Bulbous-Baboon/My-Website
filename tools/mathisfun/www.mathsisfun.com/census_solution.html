              				<h1>Census Puzzle  Solution</h1>
						</center>
       			<h2>The Puzzle:</h2>
						<p>A census taker approaches a house and asks the woman who answers the 
            door <i>"How many children do you have, and what are their ages?"</i></p>
						<p>The woman replies <i>"I have three children, the product of their ages are 36, 
							the sum of their ages are equal to the address of the house next 
							door."</i></p>
						<p>The census taker walks next door, comes back and says <i>"I need 
							more information."</i></p>
						<p>The woman replies <i>"I have to go, my oldest child is sleeping upstairs."</i></p>
						<p>Census taker then says <i>"Thank you, I now have everything I need."</i></p>
						<h2>The Solution:</h2>
						<p>The reason the census taker could not figure out the children's 
              ages is because, <b>even with knowing the number on the house next 
</b>, there were still two possibilities. </p>
						<p>The only way that the product 
              could be 36 and still leave two possibilities is when the sum equals 
              13. These possibilities being <b>9, 2 and 2</b> and <b>6, 6 and 1</b>. </p>
						<p>When the home owner 
              stated that her "oldest" child is sleeping she was giving ths census 
              taker the fact that there is an "oldest". </p>
						<p>So the children's ages are 
						   <b>9, 2 and 2</b>. </p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <div class="center80">
                          <h3>Notes</h3>
                          <p>I sometimes get asked why other possible solutions are not shown. Answer: because there aren't any more! A key element of this puzzle is that the census taker <i>needed more information!</i></p>
                          <p>For example, another way to factor 36 is 12, 3 and 1. The sum is 16. If the number next door had been 16, the census taker would not have needed to come back for more information.</p>
                          <p>Another factoring  is 6, 3 and 2. The sum is 11. Once again, the census taker would not have needed to come back if that had been the number next door. </p>
                          <p>And nor will  4, 3 and 3  work because its sum of 10 is also unique.</p>
                          <p>Hope that makes sense!</p>
