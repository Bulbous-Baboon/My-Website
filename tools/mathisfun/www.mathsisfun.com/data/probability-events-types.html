			<h1 class="center">Probability: Types of Events</h1>
			<p>Life is full of random events!</p>
			<p>You need to get a &quot;feel&quot; for them to be a smart and successful person.</p>
			<p>The toss of a coin, throw of a dice and  lottery draws are all examples of  random events.</p>
			<h2>Events</h2>
			<p>When we say &quot;Event&quot; we mean  one (or more)  outcomes.</p>
			<div class="example">
				<h3>Example  Events:</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Getting a Tail when tossing a coin is an event</li>
					<li>Rolling a &quot;5&quot;  is an event.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>An event can include several outcomes:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Choosing a &quot;King&quot;  from a deck of cards (any of the 4 Kings)<b> is also</b> an event</li>
					<li>Rolling an &quot;even number&quot;  (2, 4 or 6) is  an event</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<p>Events can be:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Independent</b> (each event is <b>not</b> affected by other events), </li>
				<li><b>Dependent</b> (also called &quot;Conditional&quot;, where  an event <b>is</b>  affected by other events)</li>
				<li><b>Mutually Exclusive</b> (events can't happen at the same time)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Let's look at each of those types.</p>
			<h2>Independent Events </h2>
			<p> Events can be  &quot;Independent&quot;, meaning  each event is <b>not affected</b> by any other events.</p>
			<p>This is an important idea! A coin does not &quot;know&quot; that it came up heads before ... each toss of a coin is a perfect isolated thing.</p>
			<div class="example">
				<p>Example: You toss a coin three times and it comes up &quot;Heads&quot; each time ... what is the chance that the next toss will also be a &quot;Head&quot;?</p>
				<p class="center larger">The chance is simply 1/2, or 50%, just like ANY OTHER toss of the coin.</p>
				<p>What it did in the past will not affect the current toss!</p>
			</div>
			<p>Some people think &quot;it is overdue for a Tail&quot;, but <i>really truly</i> the next toss of the coin is totally independent of any previous tosses.</p>
			<p class="center80">Saying &quot;a Tail is due&quot;, or &quot;just one more go, my luck is due&quot; is called <b>The Gambler's Fallacy</b>			</p>
		<p>Learn more at <a href="probability-events-independent.html">Independent Events</a>.</p>
<h2>Dependent Events</h2>
			<p> But some events can  be &quot;dependent&quot; ... which means they <b>can be affected by previous events</b>.</p>
			<div class="example">
				<h3>Example: Drawing 2 Cards from a Deck</h3>
				<p>After taking one card from the deck there are <b>less cards</b> available,  so the probabilities change!</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Let's look at  the chances of getting a King.</b></p>
				<p>For the 1st card  the chance of drawing a King is 4 out of 52</p>
				<p>But for the 2nd card:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>If  the 1st card was a King, then the 2nd card  is <b>less</b> likely to be a King, as only 3 of the 51 cards left are Kings. </li>
					<li>If  the 1st card was <b>not</b> a King, then the 2nd card  is slightly <b>more</b> likely to be a King, as 4 of the 51 cards left are King.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<p>This is because we are <b>removing cards</b> from the deck.</p>
			<div class="center80">
				<p>Replacement: When  we put each card <b>back</b> after drawing it the chances don't change, as the events are <b>independent</b>. </p>
				<p>Without Replacement: The chances will  change, and  the events are <b>dependent</b>. </p>
			</div>
			<p>You can learn more at  <a href="probability-events-conditional.html">Dependent Events: Conditional Probability</a></p>
			<h2>Tree Diagrams</h2>
			<p>When we have Dependent Events it helps to make a &quot;<a href="probability-tree-diagrams.html">Tree Diagram</a>&quot;			</p>
			<div class="example">
				<h3>Example: Soccer Game</h3>
				<p>You are off to soccer, and love being the Goalkeeper, but that depends who is the Coach today:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>with Coach Sam your probability of  being Goalkeeper is <b>0.5</b></li>
					<li>with Coach Alex your probability of  being Goalkeeper is <b>0.3</b></li>
				</ul>
				<p>Sam is Coach more often ... about 6 of every 10 games (a probability of <b>0.6</b>).</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p><b>Let's build the Tree Diagram!				</b></p>
				<p>Start with the Coaches. We know 0.6 for Sam, so it must be 0.4 for  Alex (the probabilities must add to 1):</p>
				<p class="center"><img src="images/tree-diagram-ex1-1.svg"  alt="tree diagram 1" /></p>
				<p>Then fill out the branches for Sam (0.5 Yes and 0.5 No), and then for Alex (0.3 Yes and 0.7 No):</p>
				<p class="center"><img src="images/tree-diagram-ex1-3.svg"  alt="tree diagram 3" /></p>
				<p>Now it is neatly laid out  we can calculate probabilities (read more at <a href="probability-tree-diagrams.html">Tree Diagrams</a>).</p>
			</div>
			<h2>Mutually Exclusive</h2>
		
			<p class="words"><b>Mutually Exclusive</b> means  we can't get both events at the same time.</p>
			<p>It is either one or the other, but <b>not both</b></p>
			<p>Examples:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Turning left or right are Mutually Exclusive (you can't do both at the same time)</li>
				<li>Heads and Tails are Mutually Exclusive</li>
				<li>Kings and Aces are Mutually Exclusive</li>
			</ul>
			<p>What isn't Mutually Exclusive</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Kings and Hearts are <b>not</b> Mutually Exclusive, because we can have a King of Hearts!</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Like here: </p>
			<div class="simple">
				<table align="center">
					<tr align="center">
						<td><img src="images/set-aces-kings.svg" alt="set aces kings separate" /></td>
						<td>&nbsp;</td>
						<td><img src="images/set-hearts-kings.svg"  alt="set hearts kings joins at king of hearts" /></td>
					</tr>
					<tr align="center">
						<td>Aces and Kings are <br />
							<b>Mutually Exclusive</b><br />
							(can't be both)</td>
						<td>&nbsp;</td>
						<td>Hearts and Kings are <b><br />
							not</b> Mutually Exclusive <br />
							(can be both)</td>
					</tr>
			</table>
