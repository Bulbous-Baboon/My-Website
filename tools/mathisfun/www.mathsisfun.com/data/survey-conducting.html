	<h1 align="center">How to Do a  Survey</h1>
	<p style="float:left; margin: 0 10px 5px 0;"><img src="images/interview-girls.jpg" alt="Conducting a Survey" height="162" width="250"></p>
	<h2>Survey Says ...</h2>
	<p>Turn  on the television, radio or open a newspaper and you will often see  the results from a survey.&nbsp; </p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<div class="bigul">
	  <ul>
	    <li>Gathering  information  is an important way to help people  make decisions about  topics of interest.&nbsp; </li>
	      <li>Surveys can help decide what needs changing, where money should be spent, what products to buy, what problems there might be, or lots of other questions you may  have at any time.&nbsp;</li>
	      <li>The  best part about surveys is that they can be used to answer any question about  any topic.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
	<p>You can survey <b>people</b> (through questionnaires, opinion polls, etc) or <b>things</b> (like pollution levels in a river, or traffic flow).</p>
	<h2>Four Steps</h2>
	<p>Here are four steps to a successful survey:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>Step one: create the questions</li>
	  <li>Step two: ask the questions</li>
	  <li>Step three: tally the results</li>
	  <li>Step four: present the results</li>
  </ul>
	<p>Let us look at those steps in more detail ...</p>
	<h2>Step One: Create the Questions</h2>
	<p>The first thing   is to decide is</p>
	<p class="large" align="center"> What questions do you want answered?&nbsp;  </p>
	<table align="center" width="95%" border="0">
      <tbody>
<tr>
        <td width="27%"><img src="images/survey-girl-boy.jpg" alt="Conducting a Survey" height="198" width="160"></td>
        <td width="73%">
<p>Sometimes these may be simple questions like:&nbsp; </p>
          <ul>
            <li><i align="center">"What is your favorite color?"&nbsp;  </i></li>
          </ul>
          <p>Other times the questions may be quite complex such as:&nbsp; </p>
          <ul>
            <li><i>"Which roads have the worst traffic conditions?"</i></li>
          </ul></td>
      </tr>
  </tbody></table>
	<br>
<h3>Simple Surveys</h3>
	<p>When doing a simple survey, you can use <a href="tally-marks.html">tally marks</a> to show each personâ€™s answer:</p>
	<div align="center"><img src="images/survey-tally.svg" alt="Preferred color Tally"></div>
	<p>Sometimes, it is helpful to be  creative in how the people can respond.&nbsp;  It makes it more fun for both you and your respondents (the people answering the question).&nbsp;</p>
	
    <div class="example">
    	<h3>Example:What is your favorite color?</h3>
    	<p>Have them write down their favorite color on a piece of paper and drop  it in a fish bowl.&nbsp; </p>
    	<p>Then,  put  all of the pieces of paper into piles and count them.</p>
 	</div>
    <p class="larger">&nbsp;</p>
		<div class="center80">
			<p class="larger" align="center">To help you make a good Questionnaire read our page <a href="survey-questionnaire.html">Survey Questions</a>.</p>
		</div>
	
    <h2>Step Two: Asking The Questions</h2>
    <p>Now you have your questions, <b>go out and ask them!</b> But who to ask?    </p>
    <div class="def">
    	<p>If you  survey a small group you can ask everybody (called a <b>Census</b>)    </p>
    </div>
    <br>

    <div class="def">
      <p>If you want to survey a large group, you may not be able to ask everybody so you should ask a sample of the population (called a  <b>Sample</b>)</p>
    </div>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>When you are <a href="sampling.html">sampling</a> you should be careful who you ask.  </p>
    <p style="float:right; margin: 0 0 5px 10px;"><img src="images/people.gif" alt="People" height="112" width="250"></p>
    <p>To be a good sample, each person should be chosen <b>randomly</b></p>
    <div class="so">    	If you only ask people who look friendly, you will only know what friendly people think!</div>
	<div class="so"> If you go to the swimming pool and ask people "Can you swim?" you will get a biased answer ... maybe even 100% will say "Yes"		</div>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<table align="center" width="90%" border="0">
			<tbody>
<tr>
        <td><img src="images/mobile.svg" alt="phone"></td>
         <td>&nbsp;</td>
  <td>And the surveys where people are <b>asked to respond</b> are not very accurate, because only <b>certain types of people</b> take the time to answer.</td>
      </tr>
  </tbody></table>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>So be careful not to <a href="../accuracy-precision.html">bias</a> your survey. Try to choose randomly.<br>
    </p>
    <div class="example">
      <h3>Example: You want to know the favorite colors for people at your school, but don't have the time to ask everyone.</h3>
      <p>Solution: Choose  50 people at random:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>stand at the gate and choose "the next person to arrive" each time</li>
        <li><i>or</i> choose people randomly from a list and then go and find them!</li>
        <li><i>or</i> you could choose every 5th person</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Your results will <i><b>hopefully</b></i> be nearly as good as if you asked everyone.</p>
  </div>
    <p>If you choose a person  and they do <b>not</b> want to answer,  record<b> "no answer"</b> on the survey form and mention how many people did not answer in your report.</p>
    <p>After completing a sampling survey you can use the information  to make a <b>prediction</b> as to how the rest of the population might respond.</p>
    <p>And your results are better when you ask more people. </p>
    <div class="example">
      <h3>Example: nationwide opinion polls  survey up to 2,000 people, and the results are  nearly as good (within  about 1%) as asking everyone.</h3>
      <p>But they sometimes get voting wrong, because people change their mind when actually voting.</p>
      <p>In the same way the opinion <i>"yes I would  buy this product"</i> may not mean they actually will buy it.</p>
    </div>
    <h2>Step Three: Tally the Results</h2>
    <p>Now you have finished asking questions it is time to tally the results.</p>
    <p>By "tally" I mean add up. This usually involves lots of paperwork and computer work (spreadsheets are useful!)</p>
    <div class="example">
      <p>Example: For "favorite colors of my class" you can simply write <a href="tally-marks.html">tally marks</a> like this (every fifth mark crosses the previous 4 marks, so you can easily see groups of 5):</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/survey-tally.svg" alt="Preferred color Tally"></p>
    </div>
    <h2>Step Four: Presenting the Results</h2>
    <p>Now you have your results, you will want to show them to other people in the best possible way.</p>
    <p>We have written a special page called <a href="survey-results.html">Showing the Results of  a Survey</a>, but here is a quick summary:</p>
    <h3>Tables </h3>
    <p>Sometimes, you can simply report the  information in a table.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>A table  is a very simple way to show others the results.&nbsp; A table should have a title, so those looking at it understand  what results the table shows:</p>
    <table align="center" width="80%" cellpadding="4" border="3">
      <tbody>
<tr align="center">
        <td colspan="5"><b><em>Table:</em> <em>The Favorite Colors of My  Class</em></b></td>
      </tr>
      <tr align="center">
        <th width="20%">Yellow</th>
        <th width="20%">Red</th>
        <th width="20%">Blue</th>
        <th width="20%">Green </th>
        <th width="20%">Pink</th>
      </tr>
      <tr align="center">
        <td>4</td>
        <td>5</td>
        <td>6</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>4</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody></table>
    <h3>Statistics</h3>
    <p>You can also summarize the results using statistics, such as <a href="../mean.html">mean</a> or <a href="standard-deviation.html">standard deviation</a></p>
    <div class="example">
      <h3>Example: you have lots of information about how long it takes people to get to school but it may be simpler just to present a summary such as:</h3>
      <p align="center"><i>Shortest Journey: 3 minutes<br>
        Average Journey: 22 minutes<br>
        Longest Journey: 58 minutes</i></p>
    </div>
    <h3>Graphs<b><br>
    </b></h3>
    <p>But nothing makes a report look better than a nice graph or chart.</p>
    <p>Use <a href="data-graph.html">Data Graphs (Bar, Line and Pie)</a> to make them.</p>
    <div class="example">
      <h3>Example Survey Question:&nbsp; What is your favorite color?</h3>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/bar-chart-colors.svg" alt="Favorite Colors of My Class"></p>
    </div>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="center"><b>Have fun asking  questions!!!!!</b></p>
