<h1 class="center">What To Do With Your Money</h1>

<p>Spend it! Yay!</p>
			<p>No, no no! Too much spending <b>now</b> and you won't have any money left when you <b>need it later</b>.</p>
<p class="center"><img src="images/personal-finance.svg" alt="personal finance" width="601" height="406" ></p>
			<h2>Budget</h2>
			<p>The first step is to <b><a href="budget.html">budget</a></b>: work out what you <b>need</b> to spend money on (food, rent, travel, etc.) and set aside money for each of those.</p>
<p><i>Note: our examples may not match your life ... so please use your own costs as we 
go along.</i></p>

			<div class="example">
				<p>Example: start with $600 for a week</p>
				<ul>
					<li>$100 for food</li>
					<li>$110 for rent</li>
					<li>$45 for train fares</li>
				</ul>
				<p>That comes to $255 and you are left with $345</p>
			</div>
			<p>Then put some money aside for things you will need to pay for  <b>soon</b>:</p>
			<div class="example">
				<ul>
					<li>$30 towards the next electricity bill</li>
					<li>$10 towards your phone bill</li>
					<li>$15 into your  clothes budget</li>
					<li>$25 towards your insurance</li>
				</ul>
				<p>That comes to $80 and you are left with $265</p>
			</div>

			
			<p>Then put some money aside for fun things:</p>
<div class="example">
	<ul>
		<li>$25 for one restaurant meal</li>
		<li>$20 for snacks during the week</li>
		<li>$20 for a movie night</li>
	</ul>
	<p>That comes to $65 and you are left with $200</p>
</div>
<p>Tip:  get the money as cash and put it into marked envelopes so you aren't tempted to use it for other things:</p>
<p class="center"><img src="images/budget-envelopes.svg" alt="budget envelopes: phone, movies, clothes" width="369" height="141" ></p>
<h2>Emergency Money</h2>
			<p>There are times you need extra money. Something needs fixing. Or you suddenly have to travel somewhere far. Having some emergency money gives you a good feeling of confidence.</p>
			<div class="example">
				<ul>
					<li>$20 for the emergency fund</li>
				</ul>
				<p>You are left with $180</p>
			</div>
			<h2>Pay Off Debt</h2>
			<p>Debt (particularly Credit Card debt) has high interest charges.&nbsp;Your best "investment" is to pay off that debt</p>
			<div class="example">
				<p>You have a credit card debt of $600? Put&nbsp;your $180 straight into that.</p>
				<p>It will save you a lot of interest later on. In a few weeks you will have no debt and can think of doing other things with your money.</p>
			</div>
			
			<h2>Employer Matched Retirement Savings</h2>
			<p>Some companies will match your investment in retirement savings (up to a certain amount). This is like free money!</p>
			<div class="example">
				<p>You put $50 into retirement savings, and your employer also puts in $50. That is $100 in your name!</p>
				<p>This is one of the best investments if it is available.</p>
			</div>
			<h2>Future Fund</h2>
			<p>There are things you want to do in the future. Study at University. Go on&nbsp;a vacation. Buy a house.</p>
			<p>Set up investments for those!</p>
			<div class="example">
				<p>No debt to pay off? Put your $180 into savings.</p>
			</div>
	<p>You could put  the money in:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>a bank savings account</li>
		<li>stocks and shares or unit trusts</li>
		<li>property (a trust, or buy something and  rent it out)</li>
		<li>a  small business project (maybe with friends or  neighbors)</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Retirement</h2>
			<p>You may want to retire one day. It takes a LOT of money to do that. Better start saving now.</p>
