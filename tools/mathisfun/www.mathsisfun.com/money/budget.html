				<img src="images/budget-happy.svg" alt="budget income more than expenses: happy"><br>
			<b>A Budget can help!</b></p>
			<p class="center"><span class="large">Spending less than you earn is Happiness.</span></p>
			<p>To help you get your money under control, make a budget.</p>
			<p>You can plan your whole year this way, and have money left over to save for big things like a new car, house, holidays, etc.</p>
			<p>Let's start!			</p>
			<h2>Where Does My Money Go?</h2>
			<p>Your first step is to work out where you spend your money now. If you don't know, then start keeping careful notes on every&nbsp;thing you spend money on for one month. Do the best you can to separate <b>needs</b> from <b>wants</b>.</p>
			<p>List the things you <b>need</b> and what you spend on them <b>per month</b>.</p>
			<div class="example">
				<h3> Example: Sam's <b>needs</b> for last month were:</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>$420 at the supermarket</li>
					<li>$150 on electricity</li>
					<li>$100 on transport</li>
					<li>$160 on phone and internet</li>
					<li>$115 on  insurance (car, house)</li>
					<li>$650 on rent</li>
				</ul>
				<p>That is a total of <b>$1,595</b></p>
			</div>
			<div class="you">
				<p>Your Turn: List all your expenses for last month. If you are still at school, ask to do the family budget.&nbsp;</p>
				<p>Type the numbers into a spreadsheet (like Open Office Calc or Microsoft Excel).</p>
			</div>
			<p>Now list your  <b>wants</b> (not needs) and how much  you'd like to spend on them <b>per month</b>.  </p>
			<div class="example">
				<h3>Example: Sam has these "wants":</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>$200 eating out</li>
					<li>$100 hair</li>
					<li>$60 movies</li>
					<li>$60 clothes</li>
					<li>$50  fun things</li>
				</ul>
				<p>That is a total of <b>$470</b></p>
			</div>
			<p>And then find out what is left over from what you earned.</p>
			<div class="example">
				<h3>Example: Sam earned $2500 last month, </h3>
				<p>Now let's see what is left over:</p>
				<p class="center larger">$2500 − $1,595&nbsp;− $460&nbsp;= <b>$435</b></p>
			</div>
			<p>Great! Sam has  $435 left over. It is important to have some left over here, as we will need it for other things later.</p>
			<div class="you">
				<p>Your Turn: Complete your list of wants and needs, and compare it to your income, hopefully there is some left too.</p>
			</div>
			<p>How did you go? You might need to cut your amounts back a little. We will look at that soon.</p>
			<h2>Budget for the Whole Year</h2>
			<p>Now let's make it a yearly budget. </p>
			<p>First copy your single month to  every month of the year:</p>
			<p class="center"><img src="images/budget-1.gif" alt="budget spreadsheet needs and wants" style="max-width:100%"></p>
			<p> then include budgets for Christmas, birthdays, expenses that come up yearly or quarterly ... in short  any need or want that is not monthly:</p>
<p class="center"><img src="images/budget-2.gif" alt="budget spreadsheet needs, wants and extras" style="max-width:100%"></p>
			<p>Now do totals, put in your income and find what is left each month:</p>
			<p class="center"><img src="images/budget-3.gif" alt="budget spreadsheet Totals" style="max-width:100%"></p>
			<p>Also, your first budget may not be very realistic. Expenses are going to come along that you didn't think of. That is OK, it is part of your learning experience. </p>
			<p>What if you  don't have money left over? Well, you can:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>increase your income (if you can), or</li>
				<li>reduce  expenses </li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Reducing Expenses</h2>
	<p>Go over your budget and think carefully how you can reduce each item.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Drink water, it is cheaper and healthier than sugary drinks</li>
				<li>Buy healthy snacks to replace junk food</li>
				<li>Stop eating out so much, home cooked meals are healthier anyway</li>
				<li>Look for bargains at supermarkets</li>
				<li>Cook  food in bulk and store it in the freezer</li>
				<li>Is it cheaper to use  public transport or to drive?</li>
				<li>Walk rather than drive short distances, it is cheaper and healthier</li>
				<li>A more fuel-efficient car&nbsp;can help</li>
				<li>Review your smart phone and home phone plans. Do you really need all the services?</li>
				<li>Cut back monthly subscriptions, do you really all of them?</li>
				<li>Get quotes for replacing  your insurance policies</li>
				<li>If you have high  credit card interest, shop around for better rates</li>
				<li>Relocate closer to work to save  transport costs</li>
				<li>Do you own your own house? Install solar to save on electricity</li>
				<li>If your house is far from  work, rent it out (to someone reliable!) and use that money to rent a place near work</li>
				<li>Look around for cheaper housing</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Car</h2>
<p style="float:right; margin: 0 0 5px 10px;"><img src="images/car.jpg" alt="car" title="car"><br></p>
<p>Owning and running a car is a big expense that you can look at closely. </p>
<p>A rough rule of thumb is to take the cost of fuel and <b>double it</b>. A trip that will cost you $50 in fuel actually costs about $100 due to wearing out your tyres, engine, transmission, etc and reducing the value of the car generally.</p>
<p>Also keeping an old car running can save money if it does not cost too much in fuel and repairs. A thousand or two in repairs every year can be cheaper than buying a new car.</p>
<h2>Keep Your Money Under Control</h2>
			<p style="float:left; margin: 0 10px 5px 0;"><img src="images/arrow-coins.jpg" alt="arrow coins" height="159" width="150"></p>
			<p>Keeping track of your expenses is very important!</p>
			<p>When you spend money, put it in the "Actual" column for that month. Try to discipline yourself not&nbsp;to go over your budget.</p>
			<p>But also be gentle with yourself. </p>
			<p>Think of your budget as a strict but kind friend.</p>
			<div class="example">
				<p>Wrong way: I just got paid $2500. After all expenses I should have $500 left, so I can spend $500  on a new game console!</p>
				<p>Right way: I have  spent $40 of my $100 "fun"  budget, so I can spend $60 on games.			</p>
			</div>
			<div class="example">
				<p>Wrong:  those $200 shoes are  on sale for $120. If I buy them I am saving $80</p>
				<p>Right: the shoes  cost $120, I am spending $120</p>
			</div>
			<p>Also remember that the excitement of buying often leads to a let down feeling later. Stay within your budget to always feel good about yourself.</p>
			<h2>Envelopes</h2>
			<p>This helps some people:</p>
			<p class="center"><img src="images/budget-envelopes.svg" alt="budget envelopes: phone, movies, clothes"><br>
			<b>Take out cash from the bank and put it in individual budget envelopes. <br>
			You can only spend from the envelopes.</b></p>
			<h2>Putting your Money To Good Use</h2>
			<p>Now you get to decide what to do with your left-over money. </p>
			<h2>Pay Off High Interest Debt</h2>
			<p>If you have any high-interest debt (such as credit cards), pay those off first!</p>
			<h2>Emergency Fund</h2>
			<p>Next, put money aside for emergencies. Things break down and  need  replacing or repair (plumbers are expensive). Your pet might need a vet. A friend might need help.</p>
			<p>At least $2,000. More if you can (some people suggest  3 months salary worth). </p>
			<p>It must be easy to get at (cash or bank account).</p>
			<p>Having emergency money also gives you a good sense of confidence in life.</p>
			<p class="center"><img src="images/budget-4.gif" alt="budget spreadsheet to emergency fund etc" style="max-width:100%"></p>
			<h2>Investments</h2>
			<p>When you have paid off your high interest debt, and have money in an emergency fund it is time to think about investing&nbsp;<a href="investing-introduction.html">Learn more about investing</a>.			</p>
