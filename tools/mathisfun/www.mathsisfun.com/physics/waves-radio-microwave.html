<h1 class="center">Radio  Waves and Microwaves</h1>

<p class="center"><img src="images/phone-mobile.jpg" alt="phone mobile" height="167" width="480"></p>
  <p class="center large">Radio waves and microwaves are very important to us for <b>communication</b>.</p>
  <p class="center"><i><br></i>
<img src="images/microwave.svg" alt="microwave" height="98" width="162"><i><br>And for heating up left over pizza!</i></p>


<h2>Electromagnetic</h2>

<p>They are both on the <b>long wavelength</b> end of  the <a href="electromagnetic-spectrum.html">Electromagnetic Spectrum</a>:</p>

  <div class="script" style="height: 260px;">
    images/em-spectrum.js
  </div>
  

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
    <li>Radio waves have wavelengths of <b>1 m</b> up.<br>
The frequency at 1 m is 300 MHz.</li>
    <li>Microwaves  have wavelengths of <b>1 mm</b> (millimeter) to <b>1 m</b>.<br>
The frequency at 1 mm is 300 GHz.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>(Note: some people say microwaves are just a type of radio wave, so for them radio waves have wavelengths of <b>1 mm</b> up.)</p>
  <p>We can create radio and microwaves, and they are also produced by the Sun and many other natural sources.</p>


<h2>Wireless Communication</h2>

<p>We use radio and microwaves&nbsp;to communicate without wires. This is great, as we can move around&nbsp;and live our lives while still being in touch.</p>


<h2>Transmitting and Receiving</h2>

<p class="center"><img src="images/radio-mobile-phone.svg" alt="radio mobile phone" height="" width=""><br>
Transmit ... and Receive on a device</p>
  <p>Radio waves are produced by a vibrating electric current in an antenna ...</p>
  <p class="center">... the <a href="electromagnetic-spectrum.html">electromagnetic</a> waves then spread out ...</p>
  <p>... and  are then received  by a small antenna inside your device, that detects the very small amount of current created by the radio waves.</p>
  <p>Your device can then decode the signal, and you can watch or listen to what was sent out.</p>


<h2>Broadcasting</h2>

<p>Radio waves are good at <b>broad</b>casting (sending out to lots of receivers) and that is how we get to listen to radio and TV broadcasts.</p>
  <p class="center"><img src="images/antenna-tv.svg" alt="antenna tv" height="" width=""><br>
TVs (and radios!) can  receive <b>broadcast</b> signals using  antennas.</p>
<p>Radio waves are good at bending around buildings and hills by <a href="diffraction.html">diffraction</a> (see below also).</p>


<h2>Microwave Ovens</h2>

<p>Microwave ovens use electromagnetic waves at  a  frequency of <i><b>2.45 GHz</b> (wavelength  about 12 cm)</i> that  make water molecules vibrate fast and heat up.</p>
  <p class="center"><img src="images/microwave-works.svg" alt="microwave magnetron, stirrer and pie absorbs" height="208" width="304"><br>
Microwaves are created by the Magnetron,<br>
are sent in different directions by the stirrer,<br>
bounce off metal surfaces,<br>
and are absorbed by the water in food.</p>
  <p>Microwaves can travel through glass and plastic and  penetrate about a centimeter  into food (depending on the  food), but bounce off metal surfaces.</p>
  <p>There must&nbsp;always be <b>something to absorb the microwaves</b>, such as food or a glass of water.</p>
  <p>So basically you are cooking by heating up the water in the first cm or so of the  food. That is why many recipes say to leave the food stand for a while (to let the heat spread evenly).</p>
  <p>Microwaves can also heat <b>us</b> up and can <b>damage</b> our cells. Keep the door  closed when on, and never use a damaged microwave oven.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p style="float:right; margin: 0 0 5px 10px;"><img src="images/diffraction-harbor.jpg" alt="diffraction waves in harbor" height="300" width="202"><br>
Wave diffraction  into a bay</p>


<h2><span class="center">Diffraction</span></h2>

<p><a href="diffraction.html">Diffraction</a> is very important for radio communications!</p>
  <p class="larger">Diffraction is when waves <b>bend around the corner</b> of an obstacle.</p>
  <p style="float:left; margin: 0 10px 5px 0;"><img src="images/diffractions.gif" alt="diffraction wave behaviour" height="260" width="129"></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Medium gap: <i>some diffraction, but mostly straight</i></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Gap  of <b>wavelength</b> size: <i>most diffraction</i></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The maximum effect is when the gap&nbsp;and wavelength are about the same size.</p>
  <p class="center"><img src="images/wave-diffraction-radio.svg" alt="wave diffraction radio" height="" width=""><br>
<b>Radio waves</b> with wavelengths of <b>kilometers</b> diffract<br>
over hills and through valleys so you can easily get reception.</p>
  <p class="center"><img src="images/wave-diffraction-micro.svg" alt="wave diffraction microwave" height="" width=""><br>
But microwaves  with wavelength of  <b>centimeters</b> mostly go straight.</p>
  <p style="float:right; margin: 0 0 5px 10px;"><img src="images/microwave-dish-tower.jpg" alt="microwave dish tower" height="400" width="135"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So radio waves are good at "<b>broad</b>casting" to many people, but microwaves are good at point-to-point communication.</p>
<p>And for microwaves the transmitter and receiver must be "line of sight" (they can see each other).</p>
<p>A typical microwave antenna is a <a href="../geometry/parabola.html">parabolic</a> dish of about  0.3 m to 3 m in diameter, like on this building:</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>


<h2>&nbsp;</h2>

<h2>Ionosphere</h2>

<p>The ionosphere is an  electrically charged layer of the upper atmosphere that is  between 75 and 1000 km above the ground.</p>
  <p>It is very important for radio and microwave communication!</p>
  <p>Low to medium frequency radio waves get reflected off the ionosphere, so it is possible to receive radio signals from far away&nbsp;that have bounced their way to us.</p>
  <p class="center"><img src="images/radio-microwaves-earth.svg" alt="radio microwaves earth" height="366" width="702"><br>
<i>(Not to scale)</i></p>
  <p>But microwaves can cut right through the ionosphere so they&nbsp;are good for communicating with satellites.</p>


<h2>Signal and Noise</h2>

<p class="center"><img src="../data/images/analog-digital.svg" alt="analog digital" height="161" width="360"><br>
Information can be in <a href="../data/analog-digital.html">analog or digital</a> form.</p>

<h3>Analog</h3>
  <p>Information can be put onto a wave by altering its height or wavelength a&nbsp;little:</p>
  <p class="center"><img src="../data/images/analog-picture.jpg" alt="analog picture" height="100" width="422"><br>
A wave has a <b>signal</b>&nbsp;of this picture  put into it.</p>
  <p>As the wave travels it gets  <b>noise</b> (random changes)  added by  other  electrical activity around it:</p>
  <p class="center"><img src="../data/images/analog-picture-noise.jpg" alt="analog picture noise" height="100" width="280"><br>
When we try to recreate the image&nbsp;the result is not  perfect!</p>

<h3>Digital</h3>
  <p>But with digital we  expect <b>only certain values</b>, such as 0s or 1s. So noise (if not too big) can be overcome.</p>
  <p class="center"><img src="../data/images/digital-picture-noise.jpg" alt="digital picture noise does not affect quality" height="100" width="423"><br>
Even with noise we still know every 0 and 1 and get a perfect image.</p>
