<h1 align="center">Measuring  With Maggie</h1>
<h3 align="center">An Introduction to US Standard Units</h3>
<h3 align="center">Also known as &quot;English Units&quot; or &quot;US Customary Units&quot;</h3><p style="float:left; margin: 10px;"><img src="../images/style/maggie.gif" alt="Maggie" width="155" height="209" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wow, I just flew in from planet  Micron.&nbsp; It was a long flight, but well  worth it to get to spend time with you!
</p>
<p> My name is Maggie in your language (but you couldn't pronounce my real name!)</p>
<p>When I first arrived I couldn't understand how you measure things, but my friend Tom taught me all about  measurement, and I am  going to share with you everything he taught me.</p>
<p>The first thing Tom told me was that you can measure things using two different systems: <b>US Standard Units</b> and <a href="metric-system-introduction.html">Metric</a>.</p>
<p>Today is my day to learn US Standard Units !</p>
<h2>Liquids</h2>
    <table width="100%" border="0">
      <tr>
        <td><img src="images/orange-juice.jpg" alt="orange juice" width="100" height="141" /></td>
        <td><p>Since it was such a long flight, the  first thing I could use is something cold to drink.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
          <p>But I want to be sure how much to  ask for! So I can  get a drink that is  not too big or too small.</p></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>The first  thing I need to know when asking for a drink is the <b>types of units</b> used to  measure liquids, which are:</p>
				<div id="midul">
<ul>
          <li><b>Fluid Ounces</b></li>
          <li><b>Cups</b></li>
          <li><b>Pints</b></li>
          <li><b>Quarts</b></li>
          <li><b>Gallons</b></li>
        </ul></div>
    <br />
    <table width="100%" border="0">
      <tr>
        <td><img src="images/fluid-ounce.jpg" alt="fluid ounce" width="131" height="96" /></td>
        <td><p><b>Fluid Ounces </b>(oz) are small<b>.</b>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>About how much  fits into a small medicine cup ... but that isn't  enough for someone who is thirsty!</p></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <table width="100%" border="0">
    	<tr>
        <td width="5%">&nbsp;</td>
        <td width="74%">Then Tom showed me a small carton, and told me it held 8 fluid ounces, which is also called <b>1 cup</b>. But I wanted more!</td>
        <td width="21%"><img src="images/milk-carton-8oz.gif" alt="milk carton" width="65" height="79" /></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <table width="100%" border="0">
      <tr>
        <td width="5%">&nbsp;</td>
        <td width="74%"><p>So Tom showed me a <b>pint</b>, which is equal to 2 cups.</p>
          <p>That seemed about right for someone who was very thirsty!</p></td>
        <td width="21%"><img src="images/pint.gif" alt="pint" width="71" height="118" /></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>(Tom also told me that I can measure things using  <a href="measuring-cups.html">measuring cups</a>)</p>
    <table width="100%" border="0">
      <tr>
        <td width="6%">&nbsp;</td>
        <td width="75%"><p>To  measure many cups of liquid all put together you can  use quarts.</p>
          <p>A <b>quart</b>  (qt) is the same thing as 4 cups or 2 pints.&nbsp;</p></td>
        <td width="19%"><img src="images/quart-milk.gif" alt="quart" width="120" height="99" /></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    
    <table width="100%" border="0">
      <tr>
        <td><p>If you still need more liquid you may want to switch to using  gallons.</p>
          <p>A <b>gallon</b>  (gal) is the same as 16 cups or 8 pints or 4 quarts.&nbsp; It is the largest liquid measurement.</p>
          <p>(Oh wow! A <span class="hilite">quart</span> is a <span class="hilite">quart</span>er of a gallon!)</p></td>
        <td><img width="140" height="161" src="images/gallon-jug.gif"  alt="gallon jug" /></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>So now I know that 1 ounce is too small for me, but 1 gallon is too much. I think I will ask for a pint of juice!</p>
    <p>Final  thoughts about measuring liquids:&nbsp; </p>
    <div class="center80">
      <p align="center"><strong>1  Gallon = 4 quarts = 8 pints = 16 cups= 128 fluid ounces</strong></p>
    </div><p class="center"><img src="images/us-gallon-quart-pint-cup.svg" alt="us gallon quart pint cup" /></p>
    <h2>Mass (Weight)</h2>
    <p>Next I wanted to eat some chocolate ... so I should learn about mass. You often call it &quot;weight&quot;, but it is only because  of the gravity on your planet that items have weight!&nbsp; </p>
    <p>Tom says I need to know:</p>
				<div id="midul">
<ul>
          <li><b>Ounces</b></li>
          <li><b>Pounds</b></li>
          <li><b>Tons</b></li>
          </ul></div>
    <table width="100%" border="0">
      <tr>
        <td width="7%">&nbsp;</td>
        <td width="76%"><h3>Ounces Again!</h3>
          <p>One thing that really confused me is that when I asked for a drink I could use ounces, but ounces are also used for mass ...</p>
          <p>... the same word can be used  in two different measuring systems!&nbsp; How  amazing is that? But they are really different.</p></td>
        <td width="17%"><img src="images/bathroom-scales.jpg" alt="bathroom-scales" width="102" height="102" /></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>Tom says:</p>
    <div class="center80">
      <p align="center" class="larger">If  you mean an ounce of <b>fluid </b>say <b>&quot;fluid ounce&quot;</b> (&quot;fl oz&quot;)<br />
        Otherwise ounce usually means mass.</p>
    </div>
    <p>So we are not talking about fluids! I  already had a drink. I need to know about mass.</p>
    <table width="100%" border="0">
      <tr>
        <td><img src="images/bread-slice.jpg" alt="slice of bread" width="100" height="93" /></td>
        <td><p>The  smallest unit of mass is <b>ounces</b> (oz).&nbsp;  A slice of bread is about one ounce.&nbsp; It is very light.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>But when you add up the ounces you get a new label for  mass:</p>
    <table width="100%" border="0">
      <tr>
        <td><img src="images/bathroom-scales.jpg" alt="bathroom-scales" width="102" height="102" /></td>
        <td><p>If  you have 16 ounces, it can also be called a <b>pound</b> (lb).&nbsp; Typically, this is the unit that you use to  measure your own weight.&nbsp; </p>
          <p align="center" class="large">1 pound = 16 ounces</p>
          <p>Pounds are used to measure lots of things from people to food to  animals.&nbsp; </p>
          <p>Tom says he weighs 90 pounds.</p></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    
    <p>But if something weighs  many pounds we use yet another label</p>
    <table width="100%" border="0">
      <tr>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td><p>2,000 pounds is also one <b>ton</b>.&nbsp; </p>
          <p align="center"><span class="large">1 ton = 2,000 pounds</span></p>
          <p>That is really heavy!&nbsp; Trucks, ships and heavy equipment are measured using tons instead of pounds.</p>
          <p align="right">An elephant has a mass of about <b>8 tons</b>!</p></td>
        <td valign="bottom"><img src="images/elephant.jpg" alt="elephant" width="109" height="120" /></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>So now I know that 1 ounce of chocolate is too small for me, but 1 ton is way too much. I think I will ask for a pound of chocolate!</p>
    <p>Final  thoughts about mass:</p>
    <div class="center80">
      <div align="center"> <p><strong>1  pound = 16 ounces</strong><br />
        </p>
        <p><strong>1  Ton = 2,000 pounds = 32,000 ounces</strong> </p>
      </div>
    </div>
  <h2>Length</h2>
    <p style="float:left; margin: 0 10px 5px 0;"><img src="images/carpenters-rule.jpg" alt="carpenter's rule" width="156" height="111" /></p>
    <p>The  last kind of measurement we will explore is length.&nbsp; This is important for lots of different  reasons.&nbsp; Measurement of length helps  you to know how far you have traveled, how far you have left to travel, how  tall you are and many other things.</p>
  <p>I need to know about:    </p>
				<div id="midul">
<ul>
            <li><b>Inches</b></li>
            <li><b>Feet</b></li>
            <li><b>Yards</b></li>
            <li><b>Miles</b></li>
        </ul></div>
    <table width="100%" border="0">
      <tr>
        <td><img src="images/fingers.jpg" alt="fingers" width="116" height="87" /></td>
        <td><p>Small  units of length are called <b>inches</b>.&nbsp;  </p>
          <p>The last joint of your finger or thumb is about 1  inch (depending on how big your fingers are!).</p>          </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>Lots of things are measured in  inches from rainfall to paper length. </p>
    <p>Measuring in inches gives us a way for  everyone to understand the size of something.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><img src="images/feet.jpg" alt="feet" width="133" height="133" style="float:left; margin: 10px;" /> </p>
		<p><span class="larger">When  we have 12 inches together, it is known as a <b>foot</b>.</span>&nbsp; </p>
		<p align="center" class="large">1 foot = 12 inches</p>
		<p>A long time ago, people  used their   feet to measure things. But everyone has different sized feet so it did not work very well.</p>
		<p>Using 12  inches put together to make one foot lets everyone  have an accurate  picture of what exactly a &quot;foot&quot; of length is.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p style="float:right; margin: 0 0 5px 10px;"><img src="images/guitar-length.jpg" alt="1 meter" width="259" height="172" /></p>
    <p>When  3 feet are together, this is called a yard.&nbsp; (This isn't the same thing as a lawn, though they are both  referred to as a &quot;yard&quot;!)&nbsp;</p>
		<p align="center" class="large">1 yard = 3 feet</p>
		<p>The length of this guitar is about 1 yard.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p style="float:left; margin: 0 10px 5px 0;"><img src="images/roads.jpg" alt="roads" width="156" height="100" /></p>
    <p>When  you put together 1,760 yards, you have a <b>mile</b>.&nbsp; </p>
		<p align="center" class="large">1 mile = 1,760 yards = 5,280 feet</p>
	<p>Miles are long distances and are mostly used to measure the distance  between places which are far away from each other.&nbsp; Most people refer to miles when they are driving, biking or  jogging.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Final thoughts about measuring length:</p>
    <div class="center80">
      <p align="center"><strong>1  foot = 12 inches</strong>         </p>
      <p align="center"><strong>1  yard = 3 feet = 36 inches</strong></p>
      <p align="center"><strong>1  mile = 1,760 yards = 5,280 feet = 63,360 inches</strong></p>
    </div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>    
    <p style="float:left; margin: 0 20px 5px 0;"><img src="images/thermometer.gif" alt="thermometer" width="64" height="300" /></p><h2>Temperature</h2>
    <p>I was feeling a bit hot, so I asked Tom how to measure <a href="../temperature-conversion.html">temperature</a>.</p>
		<p>So he showed me a <a href="thermometer.html">thermometer</a><b>. </b>But I saw <b>2 sets of numbers</b>!</p>
		<p>Tom explained that a thermometer measures in degrees (&deg;) of either <b>Celsius or Fahrenheit</b>. </p>
		<p><i>&quot;Why two scales?&quot;, I asked. </i></p>
		<p><i>Tom said that some people like one scale and some like the other, and that I should learn both!</i></p>
		<p>He then gave me an example: when water freezes the thermometer shows:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>0 degrees Celsius</b> on the left side, </li>
			<li>but on the right  side it shows <b>32 degrees Fahrenheit</b>.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Two numbers for the same thing!</p>
		<p>He gave me  more examples.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A hot sunny day with a temperature of <b>30 degrees Celsius</b> is  <b>86 degrees in Fahrenheit</b>. </li>
      <li>Water boils at <b>100 degrees Celsius</b> or <b>212 degrees Fahrenheit</b>. </li>
      <li>And you can bake cookies in your oven at a temperature of <b>180 degrees Celsius</b>, which is <b>356 degrees Fahrenheit</b>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I decided to get my own thermometer, so I can learn all about this.</p>
